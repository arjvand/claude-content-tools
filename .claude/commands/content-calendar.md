description: Generate a monthly content calendar based on requirements.md configuration (cross‑industry)
argument-hint: [month year] (e.g., "October 2025")
---------------------------------

# Generate Content Calendar (Cross‑Industry)

Create a comprehensive content calendar for **$ARGUMENTS** based on the editorial requirements from `requirements.md`.

**This command is cross‑industry** — it adapts to any brand, sector, cause, or program defined in `requirements.md` (e.g., consumer goods, finance, healthcare, education, nonprofit, SaaS, travel, arts & culture, public sector, etc.).

---

## Step 1: Load and Validate Configuration

**Use the `requirements-extractor` skill** to load validated configuration:

```
Please use the requirements-extractor skill to load and validate configuration.
```

**Skill will provide:**
- Structured JSON with all configuration sections
- Validation report (any errors or warnings)
- Confirmation that config is complete and valid

**If validation errors found:**
- Report errors to user
- DO NOT proceed until requirements.md is fixed
- Provide specific guidance on what needs correction

**If validation successful:**
- Configuration now available in structured format
- Use `config.project.*`, `config.content.*`, `config.competitive.*`, etc. for all subsequent steps
- Key config sections to reference:
  - **project**: industry, platform, focus_areas, official_docs
  - **audience**: primary_roles, skill_level, primary_segment
  - **brand**: name, colors, voice
  - **content**: objective, formats, mix, word_count_range, topic_pillars
  - **seo**: strategy, internal_linking, primary_cta, distribution_channels
  - **competitive**: opportunity_weights, min_opportunity_score, required_tier1_pct
  - **localization**: language, regions, spelling

**Time:** <30 seconds (vs. 1-2 minutes manual parsing)

---

## Step 1B: Verify Past Calendar Loading (MANDATORY)

**BLOCKING CHECKPOINT:** This step ensures deduplication will be performed correctly.

### Process

1. **Check for existing calendars:**
   ```bash
   ls -la project/Calendar/*/*/content-calendar.md
   ```

2. **Count calendars in 12-month lookback window:**
   - Calculate dates from target month back 12 months
   - Count calendars within window
   - Record calendar files found

3. **Validation Gate:**

   | Condition | Result |
   |-----------|--------|
   | **No past calendars exist** | Proceed with `dedup_required = false` (first calendar) |
   | **Past calendars exist** | Require theme index confirmation from @signal-researcher |
   | **Past calendars exist + NO theme index** | **BLOCK — do not proceed to Step 2** |

4. **If past calendars found, require this confirmation from @signal-researcher:**

   ```markdown
   ## Theme Index Loaded ✅

   **Calendars Analyzed:** [N]
   **Past Topics Indexed:** [N]
   **Lookback Window:** [start] to [end]

   **Core Theme Saturation (6-Month Window):**
   [List of saturated vs available core themes]

   **Index Status:** ✅ READY
   ```

   **If this confirmation is NOT present:** STOP and request theme index loading before proceeding.

5. **Record for later verification:**
   - `past_calendars_found`: [N]
   - `theme_index_confirmed`: true/false
   - `dedup_required`: true/false

**CRITICAL:** Calendar generation MUST NOT proceed to Step 2 without theme index confirmation (when past calendars exist).

---

## Step 1A: Load Performance Insights (Optional but Recommended)

**Use the `content-performance-analyzer` skill** to inform strategy with historical data:

```
Please use the content-performance-analyzer skill to analyze the last 6 months and provide recommendations for [Month Year] calendar.
```

**Skill will provide:**
- High-performing topic/format patterns
- Content mix optimization recommendations
- Topic pillar prioritization
- Seasonal insights for target month
- Refresh opportunities for existing content

**If insights available:**
- Adjust focus area priorities based on performance data
- Consider format distribution recommendations
- Note high-ROI topic areas
- Factor in seasonal patterns

**If no insights available (new blog or insufficient data):**
- Proceed with configured strategy from requirements.md
- Note: "First calendar - no historical performance data yet"

**Time:** 2-3 minutes (provides strategic intelligence)
**Skip if:** Fewer than 10 published articles, or time-constrained

Use insights to inform topic selection and content mix in subsequent steps.

---

## Step 2: Generate Topic Candidates (Automated)

**Delegate to the `@signal-researcher` agent** for domain-aware signal discovery and topic generation:

```
Agent: @signal-researcher
Input: Target month/year from $ARGUMENTS
```

**Agent will:**
1. Load configuration (via requirements-extractor skill)
2. Select appropriate signal types for configured industry
3. Execute parallel web searches for current signals
4. Synthesize topic candidates from all viable signals (no arbitrary limit)
5. Perform preliminary quality screening:
   - Feasibility assessment (resources, SME needs, word count fit)
   - Relevance scoring (focus areas, audience, content mix)
   - Novelty check (internal duplicates, external saturation)
   - Risk flagging (compliance, legal, time-sensitive)
6. Generate structured `topic-candidates.md` document

**Agent Output:**
- File: `project/Calendar/{Year}/{Month}/topic-candidates.md`
- Contains: All viable topic candidates with:
  - Provisional Article IDs (ART-YYYYMM-001 onwards, sequential)
  - Signal sources and dates
  - Strategic rationale (why now, why us)
  - Preliminary scores (feasibility, relevance, novelty)
  - Recommended priority for gap analysis

**Time:** Scales with signal availability (typically 10-20 minutes)
**Benefits:**
- Systematic signal discovery across all industries
- Consistent quality screening
- Clear documentation of rationale
- Better topic candidates → higher average opportunity scores
- No artificial caps on opportunity identification

**What You'll Receive:**

Summary format:
```

```

Proceed to Step 2A with all generated topic candidates.

---

## Step 2A: Competitive Gap Pre-Analysis (Batch Mode - High Performance)

**Objective:** Analyze all topic candidates in parallel to assess differentiation opportunity and prioritize topics strategically.

### Why Batch Mode?

- **Speed**: 40% faster than sequential analysis
- **Consistency**: All topics analyzed with same competitor baseline
- **Intelligence**: Shared competitor data, intelligent caching
- **Efficiency**: Parallel searches, reduced API calls
- **Scalability**: Handles any number of topic candidates efficiently

### Process

**Invoke the `competitive-gap-analyzer` skill in BATCH MODE:**

```
Please use the competitive-gap-analyzer skill in batch mode to analyze all topic candidates from topic-candidates.md.
```

**Skill will:**
1. **Keyword Clustering**: Group similar topics, identify overlapping competitors
2. **Parallel Discovery**: Execute all web searches simultaneously, cache results
3. **Parallel Analysis**: Analyze competitor content in batches, build shared database
4. **Gap Scoring**: Calculate opportunity scores for all topics, reuse cached data
5. **Output Generation**: Save individual summaries + batch results

**Skill Output:**

Individual summary files for each topic candidate:
```
project/Calendar/{Year}/{Month}/gap-pre-analysis/
├── ART-YYYYMM-001-summary.md
├── ART-YYYYMM-002-summary.md
├── ...
└── ART-YYYYMM-[N]-summary.md
```

Batch results JSON (structured data):
```
project/Calendar/{Year}/{Month}/gap-pre-analysis/batch-results.json
```

**Summary Format (per topic):**
```markdown
## [Topic/Keyword]
**Article ID:** ART-YYYYMM-NNN
**Opportunity Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.2/5.0)
**Tier:** Tier 1 (High Opportunity)

### Gap Breakdown

Ready for: Topic Selection & SME Assessment
```

---

## Step 2B: Deduplication Report Verification (MANDATORY)

**BLOCKING CHECKPOINT:** This step verifies that deduplication was performed before topic selection.

### Required Artifact

When `dedup_required = true` (past calendars exist), the @signal-researcher agent MUST have saved:

```
project/Calendar/{Year}/{Month}/deduplication-report.md
```

### Verification Process

1. **Check for deduplication report:**
   ```bash
   ls -la project/Calendar/{Year}/{Month}/deduplication-report.md
   ```

2. **Verify report contains required sections:**
   - [ ] Executive Summary with statistics
   - [ ] Comparison Matrix (ALL candidates listed)
   - [ ] HARD BLOCKED Topics section (if any)
   - [ ] BLOCKED Topics section (if any)
   - [ ] Core Theme Saturation Analysis
   - [ ] Validation Signature with checkboxes

3. **Validation Gate:**

   | Condition | Result |
   |-----------|--------|
   | `dedup_required = false` (first calendar) | Proceed (no report needed) |
   | Report exists with all required sections | Proceed to topic selection |
   | Report missing | **BLOCK — request @signal-researcher to regenerate** |
   | Report incomplete | **BLOCK — request @signal-researcher to complete** |

4. **Extract key metrics for calendar header:**
   - `past_calendars_analyzed`: [N]
   - `past_topics_indexed`: [N]
   - `candidates_before_dedup`: [N]
   - `blocked_by_dedup`: [N]
   - `passed_topics`: [N]

5. **Verify no blocked topics in final selection:**
   - Cross-check selected topics against "HARD BLOCKED" and "BLOCKED" lists
   - If any blocked topic is in selection → **REJECT and request correction**

**CRITICAL:** Calendar generation MUST NOT proceed to Step 3 without verified deduplication report (when past calendars exist).

---

### Topic Selection Strategy

**Select all topics meeting quality thresholds for final calendar using batch results:**

1. **Tier Balance (ENFORCED):**
   - Minimum 60% Tier 1 topics (use `config.competitive.required_tier1_pct`)
   - No maximum total number of topics
   - Include all Tier 1 and Tier 2 topics by default
   - Include Tier 3 IF strategic value (explicit rationale required)
   - Exclude all Tier 4 topics (note in exclusions)

2. **Content Mix Compliance:**
   - Maintain `config.content.mix` percentages across final selection
   - Within each format, prioritize higher-opportunity topics
   - Scale total volume based on available high-quality opportunities

3. **Feasibility Filter:**
   - Only include Medium or High feasibility
   - Low feasibility requires user approval

4. **Diversity Check:**
   - Variety across `config.content.topic_pillars`
   - Avoid 3+ consecutive similar topics
   - Balance quick wins (recency) with evergreen (depth)

**Document Selection Rationale:**
- Opportunity tier and score
- Primary gap type + competitive advantage
- Why it beats other candidates in format category

**Document Exclusions:**
- Why excluded (saturation, feasibility, mix balance)
- Alternative angle suggestions

---

## Step 3: Generate the Content Calendar

Create a table for **$ARGUMENTS** with the structure below. **Enhanced with competitive gap analysis columns.**

Include all selected topics (no limit on number of rows).

| ID | Week | Publish Date | Topic / Working Title | Format | Channel | Audience Segment | Funnel Stage | Keyword / Search Intent | **Opp. Score** | **Primary Gap** | **Differentiation Angle** | **Media Opp** | Word Count | Goal / KPI | Primary CTA | Source Type | SME? | Priority |
| -- | ---- | ------------ | --------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- | -------- |

**New Column Descriptions:**
- **Opp. Score**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (1-5 stars) — Overall competitive opportunity score from gap pre-analysis
- **Primary Gap**: Coverage/Depth/Format/Recency — Primary type of competitive advantage identified
- **Differentiation Angle**: One sentence describing how this article will demonstrably exceed competitors
- **Media Opp**: High/Moderate/Low — Opportunity for media embeds (videos, social posts, examples)
  - **High**: Tutorials/how-tos (demo videos), expert analysis (social posts), case studies (visual examples)
  - **Moderate**: Product reviews (official announcements), comparisons (visual demonstrations)
  - **Low**: News/announcements (time-sensitive), text-only analysis (no visual value)
- **Priority**: Tier 1 (🟢 high-opp), Tier 2 (🟡 moderate-opp), Tier 3 (🟠 strategic) — Strategic importance

### ID Generation Rules

* **Format**: `ART-YYYYMM-NNN` (e.g., `ART-202510-001`)
* Parse month and year from `$ARGUMENTS`
* Generate sequential IDs starting from **001** (pad with leading zeros)

### Requirements for Each Topic (Enforced)

1. **Originality**: Distinct angle; confirm low saturation and cite primary sources.
2. **Timeliness**: Anchor to recent (≤ 3 months) or upcoming (≤ 3 months) signals.
3. **Relevance**: Align with **Industry/Brand**, **Themes**, **Audience**, **Locale**, and **Channels** from config.
4. **Audience Fit**: Match the specified **persona** and **funnel stage**; state the expected reader outcome.
5. **Search & Discovery**: Include a primary keyword (if SEO channel) and define search intent.
6. **Compliance & Ethics**: Respect regulatory constraints (e.g., financial/medical claims), brand claims policy, accessibility and inclusivity guidelines; add required **disclaimers**.
7. **Length & Packaging**: Set length by format (e.g., blog 800–1,800 words; report 1,500–3,000; social short‑form 15–60s; video 3–8 min; podcast 20–40 min). Provide channel‑specific caption or thumbnail hook where applicable.
8. **Distribution & Repurposing**: Suggest at least **2 spin‑offs** (e.g., thread, reel, carousel, email snippet) and **1 collaboration** idea (partner, creator, association) when relevant.

### Content Mix (Flexible Volume)

Use **Content Mix** percentages from `requirements.md` (e.g., Tutorials/How‑tos, Explainers, Case Studies, Data/Trends, Opinion/POV, News/Announcements, Community/Stories). Scale percentages to the total number of selected topics.

---

## Step 4: Validation Checklist (Per Topic)

* **Duplication Check**: Search to confirm novelty; specify the unique angle.
* **Recency Check**: Link to the trigger (policy change, event, report, launch) and date.
* **Compliance Check**: Note any required legal/ethical disclaimers. Avoid individualized advice.
* **Feasibility Check**: Confirm access to data, spokespeople, or assets needed.
* **Measurement Plan**: Identify 1–2 leading indicators (e.g., CTR, save rate) and a primary KPI.

---

## Step 5: SME Requirements Assessment (Automated)

**Use the `sme-complexity-assessor` skill** for systematic SME requirement determination:

```
Please use the sme-complexity-assessor skill to assess all selected topics from the calendar.
```

**Skill will assess each topic across 4 dimensions:**
1. **Technical Depth** (1-5★): Code complexity, advanced concepts, edge cases
2. **Domain Specificity** (1-5★): Specialized knowledge requirements
3. **Risk Level** (1-5★): Misinformation potential, security, compliance
4. **Verification Needs** (1-5★): Hands-on testing, production validation

**Skill Output:**

Individual SME assessments per topic:
- **Composite Complexity Score** (1-5): Weighted average of 4 dimensions
- **SME Requirement Level**:
  - ✅ **No SME** (score <2.5, no dimension ≥4): Standard editorial review
  - ⚠️ **SME Recommended** (score 2.5-3.9, any dimension =4): Beneficial but not critical
  - 🚨 **SME Required** (score ≥4.0 OR risk ≥4): Critical for quality/safety
- **SME Profile**: Specific expertise needed (not vague "expert")
  - Example: "Senior [Platform] Developer (5+ years)" NOT "SME needed"
- **Review Scope**: Which sections need validation (not "entire article")
- **Estimated Time**: 30 min, 1 hour, 2-3 hours
- **Risk Flags**: Security, legal/compliance, benchmarks, medical advice

Batch summary table:
```markdown
## SME Requirements Summary

**Topics Assessed:** [N]
**Breakdown:**
- ✅ No SME: [X] topics ([Y]%)
- ⚠️ SME Recommended: [X] topics ([Y]%)
- 🚨 SME Required: [X] topics ([Y]%)

### SME Required
| ID | Title | Score | Risk | SME Profile | Time |
|----|-------|-------|------|-------------|------|
[List all SME Required topics]

### SME Recommended
| ID | Title | Score | Driver | SME Profile | Time |
|----|-------|-------|--------|-------------|------|
[List all SME Recommended topics]

**Total SME Time:** [X-Y] hours
**SME Profiles Needed:**
[List unique SME profiles needed]

**Recommendation:** Engage SMEs during planning to confirm availability.
```

**Add to Calendar:**
- Column: "SME Requirements" → None | Recommended (profile) | Required (profile)
- Column: "Est. Review Time" → 30m, 1h, 2h, etc.
- Notes: Total SME hours and profiles needed

**Time:** 1-2 minutes (systematic assessment)
**Benefits:**
- Objective complexity scoring (not gut feel)
- Specific SME profiles (better resource planning)
- Scoped reviews (section-level, not full article)
- Consistent flagging criteria across all calendars

---

## Step 6: Save to Calendar Directory

1. Parse the month and year from `$ARGUMENTS`
2. Create the directory structure: `project/Calendar/{Year}/{Month}/`
3. Save the complete calendar as: `project/Calendar/{Year}/{Month}/content-calendar.md`
4. Confirm the file has been saved successfully

---

## Output Format

1. **Calendar Table** (as above with enhanced gap analysis columns)

2. **Deduplication Verification** (REQUIRED section — must appear in every calendar)

   Include this section at the top of the calendar, after the header:

   ```markdown
   ---

   ## Deduplication Verification

   This calendar was generated with mandatory deduplication checks.

   | Metric | Value |
   |--------|-------|
   | **Past Calendars Analyzed** | [N] |
   | **Past Topics Indexed** | [N] |
   | **Candidates Before Dedup** | [N] |
   | **HARD BLOCKED (Core Theme)** | [N] |
   | **BLOCKED (Similarity)** | [N] |
   | **Final Topic Count** | [N] |

   **Theme Spacing Compliance:**
   - ✅ No core themes repeated within 6 months
   - ✅ All similar themes (0.40+) have sufficient differentiation
   - ✅ No near-duplicates (0.80+) in final calendar

   **Deduplication Report:** See `deduplication-report.md` for full comparison matrix.

   ---
   ```

   **Note:** If this is the first calendar (no past calendars exist), display:
   ```markdown
   ## Deduplication Verification

   **Status:** First calendar for this project — no deduplication required.

   ---
   ```

3. **Competitive Gap Analysis Summary** (required section below table)

   Include this section immediately after the calendar table:

   ```markdown
   ---

   ## Competitive Gap Analysis Summary

   ### High-Opportunity Topics (Tier 1) 🟢

   **ART-YYYYMM-NNN: [Topic Title]** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.8/5)
   - **Primary Gap**: Recency (critical) / Coverage (critical) / Depth (high-value) / Format (moderate)
   - **Differentiation Angle**: "First guide covering [new feature] with [unique element]"
   - **Key Opportunities**:
     - 0/10 competitors cover [specific feature/subtopic] (coverage gap)
     - 8/10 competitors outdated (version X vs current version Y) (recency gap)
     - 9/10 lack [code examples/diagrams/templates] (depth/format gap)
   - **Why We'll Win**: [First-mover advantage / Comprehensive depth / Unique format]
   - **Pre-Analysis Reference**: `gap-pre-analysis/ART-YYYYMM-NNN-summary.md`

   [Repeat for all Tier 1 topics]

   ### Moderate-Opportunity Topics (Tier 2) 🟡

   **ART-YYYYMM-NNN: [Topic Title]** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (3.7/5)
   [Same format as Tier 1]

   ### Strategic Topics (Tier 3) 🟠

   **ART-YYYYMM-NNN: [Topic Title]** ⭐⭐⭐ (2.8/5)
   - **Why Included Despite Lower Score**: [Brand alignment / Product launch tie-in / Audience request / Pillar completion]
   - [Rest of format as above]

   ### Topics Excluded from Calendar

   **[Topic Title]** — ⭐ (1.8/5) — **Reason**: Oversaturated (10/10 high-quality competitors published <30 days)
   **[Topic Title]** — ⭐⭐ (2.3/5) — **Reason**: Low feasibility (requires lab testing, SME unavailable)
   **[Topic Title]** — ⭐⭐ (2.5/5) — **Reason**: Content mix balance (already 70% tutorials, need more analysis)

   **Alternative Angles to Consider**:
   - [Excluded Topic 1]: Try narrower focus on [specific use case/audience]
   - [Excluded Topic 2]: Wait for [upcoming release/event] then revisit with recency angle
   ```

3. **Below the gap analysis summary, include for each item:**

   * **Rationale** (originality & timeliness; what trigger you're tying to)
   * **SME requirement** (if any) and proposed reviewer profile
   * **CTA placement** (aligning with `PRIMARY_CTA` from config)
   * **Distribution & Repurposing ideas** (by channel)
   * **Measurement plan** (KPI + leading indicator)

> **Note:** For sensitive categories (health, finance, legal, safety), include a short disclaimer and avoid personalized advice. Respect accessibility standards (headings, alt text, color contrast), and ensure inclusivity in examples and imagery.
