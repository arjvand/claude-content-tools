```

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Configuration

### Step 1A: Load Configuration

**Invoke `requirements-loader` agent:**

```
Invoke requirements-loader agent for full config extraction.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Validated config JSON
- Brand voice, audience, compliance settings
- CMS platform configuration

**Blocking Gate:** If validation errors → STOP and report to user.

---

### Step 1B: Parse Calendar Entry

1. Read calendar file: `$1`
2. Extract details for Article ID: `$2`
   - Title, format, primary keyword
   - Funnel stage, publish date, CTA
   - SME requirements

3. Establish reference date:
   - Parse `publish_date` → `$REFERENCE_DATE`
   - If `$REFERENCE_DATE < TODAY` → `$HISTORICAL_MODE = true`

4. Create article directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]"
   ```

**Time:** <1 minute

---

### Step 1C: Load Calendar Context (NEW)

**Objective:** Reuse strategic analysis from calendar generation to avoid duplicate work

**Check for gap pre-analysis:**

```bash
# Extract year and month from calendar path
CALENDAR_DIR=$(dirname "$1")
PRE_ANALYSIS_PATH="${CALENDAR_DIR}/gap-pre-analysis/[ARTICLE-ID]-summary.md"

# Check if pre-analysis exists
if [ -f "$PRE_ANALYSIS_PATH" ]; then
  echo "✅ Gap pre-analysis found - loading calendar context"
else
  echo "⚠️ No gap pre-analysis found - will run full analysis in research phase"
fi
```

**If pre-analysis exists, extract strategic context:**

1. Read `gap-pre-analysis/[ARTICLE-ID]-summary.md`
2. Extract key context:
   - **Opportunity Score**: Numeric score (0.0-5.0)
   - **Tier Classification**: T1 (≥4.0), T2 (3.0-3.9), T3 (2.0-2.9), T4 (<2.0)
   - **Primary Differentiation Angle**: Main competitive advantage
   - **Top Opportunities**: 3-5 specific differentiation tactics
   - **Competitive Landscape Summary**: High-level market context

3. Save extracted context to:
   ```bash
   project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/calendar-context.json
   ```

**Context JSON format:**

```json
{
  "source": "calendar_pre_analysis",
  "article_id": "ART-202510-001",
  "opportunity_score": 4.2,
  "tier": "T1",
  "primary_angle": "First comprehensive guide covering X feature",
  "top_opportunities": [
    "Coverage gap: 0/10 competitors address Y",
    "Depth gap: Only surface-level explanations elsewhere",
    "Format gap: No step-by-step tutorials available"
  ],
  "landscape_summary": "High competition (10+ ranking articles) but significant depth gaps",
  "skip_full_gap_analysis": true,

  "pre_analysis_date": "2025-10-01",
  "gap_breakdown": {
    "coverage": 5.0,
    "depth": 4.5,
    "format": 3.0,
    "recency": 4.8
  },
  "feasibility": "HIGH",
  "competitor_count": 8,
  "recommendation": "INCLUDE",
  "staleness": "FRESH",
  "days_old": 3
}
```

**Extraction Instructions:**

When extracting from gap-pre-analysis summary:

1. **Core fields** (already extracted):
   - opportunity_score, tier, primary_angle, top_opportunities, landscape_summary

2. **NEW: Extract gap breakdown scores** from pre-analysis:
   - Look for "Coverage Score:", "Depth Score:", "Format Score:", "Recency Score:"
   - Extract numeric values (0.0-5.0 scale)
   - If not found, default to null

3. **NEW: Extract metadata fields**:
   - feasibility: Look for "Feasibility: HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW"
   - competitor_count: Count competitors analyzed (e.g., "analyzed 8 competitors")
   - recommendation: Look for "INCLUDE|CONSIDER|EXCLUDE"
   - pre_analysis_date: Extract date from pre-analysis filename or content

4. **NEW: Calculate staleness**:
   ```bash
   # Calculate days between pre-analysis and today
   DAYS_OLD=$(( ($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$PRE_ANALYSIS_DATE" +%s)) / 86400 ))

   # Determine staleness status
   if [ $DAYS_OLD -lt 7 ]; then
     STALENESS="FRESH"
   elif [ $DAYS_OLD -lt 14 ]; then
     STALENESS="AGING"
   else
     STALENESS="STALE"
   fi
   ```

5. **Staleness warning**:
   - If STALE (>14 days): ⚠️ Warn that competitive landscape may have shifted
   - Suggest running fresh gap analysis or validating pre-analysis is still relevant

**Pass context flags to research phase:**
- `CALENDAR_CONTEXT_AVAILABLE = true|false`
- `SKIP_FULL_GAP_ANALYSIS = true|false` (only if pre-analysis exists AND staleness != STALE)
- `TIER_CLASSIFICATION = T1|T2|T3|T4` (for tier-adaptive research)
- `STALENESS_STATUS = FRESH|AGING|STALE` (for researcher awareness)

**Time:** 1.5-2.5 minutes (increased from 1-2 min due to additional field extraction)

---

### Step 1D: Content Mix Validation (OPTIONAL - 1 minute)

**Objective:** Ensure monthly format targets are balanced

**Check content mix allocation:**

1. Read parent calendar: `content-calendar.md`
2. Find "Content Mix Distribution" section
3. Extract format targets (e.g., 40% Analysis, 35% Tutorials, 25% News)

4. Count current format allocation in calendar:
   ```bash
   # Example: Count tutorials
   TUTORIAL_COUNT=$(grep "Format: Tutorial" content-calendar.md | wc -l)
   TOTAL_ARTICLES=$(grep "^## Article" content-calendar.md | wc -l)
   TUTORIAL_PCT=$((100 * TUTORIAL_COUNT / TOTAL_ARTICLES))
   ```

5. Compare current article format to targets:
   - If format allocation is **>10% over target**: ⚠️ Warn user
   - If format allocation is **within target**: ✅ Proceed

**Warning Example:**
```
⚠️ Content Mix Warning:
- Current Tutorial allocation: 45% (5 of 11 articles)
- Target Tutorial allocation: 35%
- This article is Tutorial format, pushing to 55%
- Consider switching to Analysis or News format to balance mix

Proceed? (Y/n)
```

**Document validation in meta.yml:**
```yaml
content_mix_validation:
  format: "Tutorial"
  target_pct: 35
  current_pct: 45
  status: "over_allocated"
  recommendation: "Consider alternative format for next article"
```

**Time:** 1 minute

---

### Step 1E: Theme Deduplication Check (OPTIONAL - 1 minute)

**Objective:** Catch unexpected topic overlap with past 6-12 months

**Check for theme index:**

```bash
# Look for theme index in calendar directory
THEME_INDEX="project/Calendar/theme-index.json"

if [ -f "$THEME_INDEX" ]; then
  echo "✅ Theme index found - checking for similar topics"
else
  echo "⚠️ No theme index - skipping deduplication check"
  # Optional: Suggest running theme-index-builder skill
fi
```

**If theme index exists:**

1. Read `theme-index.json`
2. Extract current article topic/title
3. Search for similar topics in past 6-12 months:
   - Exact keyword match: 🚨 High similarity
   - Semantic similarity >80%: ⚠️ Moderate similarity
   - Semantic similarity >70%: 🟡 Low similarity

4. If similarity detected:
   ```
   ⚠️ Topic Similarity Warning:
   - Current topic: "WooCommerce HPOS Migration Guide"
   - Similar past topic: "Migrating to WooCommerce HPOS" (July 2025)
   - Similarity score: 85%
   - Recommendation: Differentiate by focusing on [specific angle]

   Differentiation requirements:
   - Cover [aspect not covered in past article]
   - Target different audience segment
   - Update with latest developments since July

   Proceed? (Y/n)
   ```

**Pass differentiation requirements to research phase:**
- Add to research brief: "Differentiate from past article by..."
- Flag for extra attention in gap analysis

**Document validation in meta.yml:**
```yaml
theme_deduplication:
  similar_topics_found: true
  most_similar:
    article_id: "ART-202507-003"
    title: "Migrating to WooCommerce HPOS"
    similarity_score: 0.85
    date: "2025-07-15"
  differentiation_strategy: "Focus on edge cases and rollback procedures"
```

**Time:** 1 minute

---

### Step 1F: Load GSC Article Data (CONDITIONAL - 2-3 minutes)

**Condition:** `config.analytics.gsc` exists and export path is valid. If GSC is not configured, skip this step silently and proceed to Phase 2.

**Objective:** Load real search performance data for the target keyword to enhance research, keyword analysis, SEO optimization, and editorial review.

**Invoke `gsc-analyst` agent in article mode:**

```
Invoke gsc-analyst agent in article mode.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Target Keyword: "[primary keyword from calendar entry]"
Page URL: [existing URL from meta.yml if this is an update, otherwise omit]
```

**Expected Output:** `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/gsc-article-data.md`

Contents include:
- **Ranking Context**: Current position, impressions, CTR, opportunity score for target keyword
- **Query Ecosystem**: Primary, secondary, long-tail, and question-form queries users actually search
- **CTR Analysis**: Actual vs expected CTR gap with optimization recommendations
- **Content Recommendations**: Suggested H2/H3 sections and FAQ entries from query data
- **Untargeted Opportunities**: Valuable queries no current page covers well

**Pass GSC context flags to subsequent phases:**
- `GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE = true|false`
- `GSC_ARTICLE_DATA_PATH = project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/gsc-article-data.md`

**Data Flow to Downstream Steps:**

| Consumer | Data Passed | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| @researcher Agent 1 | Query ecosystem (primary + secondary queries) | Scope research to cover queries users actually search |
| @researcher Agent 2 | Ranking context (position data) | Real competitive positioning context |
| keyword-analyst | Impressions as volume signal, GSC long-tail queries | Replace proxy estimation with real data |
| @writer | Expansion queries, question-form queries | Additional H2/H3 sections, FAQ entries |
| seo-optimizer | Authority scores, CTR benchmarks | Authority-ranked internal links, CTR targets |
| @editor | Full query ecosystem list | Validate high-impression queries are addressed |

**If GSC data unavailable:** All downstream steps proceed with their standard (non-GSC) workflows. No step is blocked by absent GSC data.

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

---

## Phase 2: Research (Parallel Execution)

### Step 2A: Tier-Adaptive Parallel Research (UPDATED)

**Tier-Based Research Strategy:**

Based on opportunity score from Step 1C, allocate research depth:

- **Tier 1 (≥4.0)**: Full parallel research (both agents, comprehensive depth)
  - Time: 15-20 minutes (parallel execution)
  - Why: High-opportunity content deserves maximum research investment

- **Tier 2 (3.0-3.9)**: Standard parallel research (both agents, standard depth)
  - Time: 10-15 minutes (parallel execution)
  - Why: Solid opportunities warrant balanced research effort

- **Tier 3 (2.0-2.9)**: Streamlined research (Agent 1 only, focused depth)
  - Time: 8-12 minutes (single agent)
  - Why: Lower opportunities get efficient, targeted research

- **Tier 4 (<2.0)**: Minimal research (Agent 2 landscape only, light depth)
  - Time: 5-8 minutes (single agent)
  - Why: Minimal opportunities receive minimal research resources

**Default (no tier data)**: Standard Tier 2 research

---

**Launch Research Agents Based on Tier:**

**Tier 1 or Tier 2 - Launch BOTH agents IN PARALLEL:**

**Agent 1 - Primary Research (@researcher):**
```
Invoke @researcher agent for primary sources.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Focus: Authoritative sources, evidence verification
Reference Date: $REFERENCE_DATE
Historical Mode: $HISTORICAL_MODE
Calendar Context: [Pass calendar-context.json if available]
Funnel Stage: [Awareness|Consideration|Decision] (from calendar entry)
Research Depth: [Full for T1, Standard for T2]
GSC Data: [Pass gsc-article-data.md path if GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true]
Output: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/research-primary.md
```

**GSC Enhancement for Agent 1 (conditional):**
If `GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true`, pass the query ecosystem from `gsc-article-data.md`:
- **Primary queries**: These are what real users search for around this topic -- research must cover these exact queries
- **Question-form queries**: Real FAQ demand -- ensure research addresses these questions
- **Secondary queries**: Related themes to broaden research scope
- Agent 1 uses GSC queries to validate research coverage (are we answering what users actually ask?)

**Agent 2 - Landscape Research (@researcher):**
```
Invoke @researcher agent for landscape analysis.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Focus: Competitive landscape, gap analysis, media discovery
Reference Date: $REFERENCE_DATE
Historical Mode: $HISTORICAL_MODE
Calendar Context: [Pass calendar-context.json if available]
Funnel Stage: [Awareness|Consideration|Decision] (from calendar entry)
Skip Gap Analysis: [true if pre-analysis exists, false otherwise]
Research Depth: [Full for T1, Standard for T2]
GSC Data: [Pass gsc-article-data.md path if GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true]
Output: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/research-landscape.md
```

**GSC Enhancement for Agent 2 (conditional):**
If `GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true`, pass the ranking context from `gsc-article-data.md`:
- **Current position data**: Real ranking context replaces guesswork about competitive positioning
- **CTR analysis**: Identifies whether existing SERP presence has snippet optimization opportunities
- **Untargeted opportunities**: Queries with high impressions but poor coverage -- landscape analysis should address these gaps

**⚠️ PARALLEL NOTE:** Both agents MUST be launched in a SINGLE message.

---

**Tier 3 - Launch Agent 1 ONLY (Primary Sources):**

**Agent 1 - Streamlined Primary Research (@researcher):**
```
Invoke @researcher agent for focused primary sources.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Focus: Core authoritative sources, essential evidence
Reference Date: $REFERENCE_DATE
Historical Mode: $HISTORICAL_MODE
Calendar Context: [Pass calendar-context.json if available]
Funnel Stage: [Awareness|Consideration|Decision] (from calendar entry)
Research Depth: Focused (streamlined mode)
GSC Data: [Pass gsc-article-data.md path if GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true]
Output: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/research-primary.md
```

Note: Skip Agent 2 and gap analysis for Tier 3. Use calendar pre-analysis context directly.

**GSC Enhancement (conditional):** If GSC data available, Agent 1 uses the query ecosystem to focus streamlined research on queries with highest real impressions. This is especially valuable for Tier 3 where research time is limited -- GSC data ensures the limited research covers what users actually search for.

---

**Tier 4 - Launch Agent 2 ONLY (Landscape Overview):**

**Agent 2 - Minimal Landscape Research (@researcher):**
```
Invoke @researcher agent for landscape overview.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Focus: Quick competitive overview, basic context
Reference Date: $REFERENCE_DATE
Historical Mode: $HISTORICAL_MODE
Calendar Context: [Pass calendar-context.json if available]
Skip Gap Analysis: true (use pre-analysis)
Research Depth: Light (minimal mode)
GSC Data: [Pass gsc-article-data.md path if GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true]
Output: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/research-landscape.md
```

Note: Skip Agent 1 for Tier 4. Minimal research for low-opportunity content.

**GSC Enhancement (conditional):** If GSC data available, Agent 2 uses position data to quickly contextualize the competitive landscape from actual ranking data rather than SERP estimation.

---

**Time Investment by Tier:**
- T1: 15-20 minutes (maximum quality)
- T2: 10-15 minutes (standard quality)
- T3: 8-12 minutes (efficient quality)
- T4: 5-8 minutes (minimal viable quality)

---

### Step 2B: Keyword Analysis

**Invoke `keyword-analyst` agent:**

```
Invoke keyword-analyst agent in full mode.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Primary Keyword: "[primary keyword from calendar entry]"
GSC Data: [Pass gsc-article-data.md path if GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true]
```

**GSC Enhancement (conditional):**
If `GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true`, the keyword-analyst receives:
- **Real impressions** from Queries.csv to replace proxy-based volume estimation
- **GSC long-tail queries**: Actual queries from the query ecosystem supplement autocomplete mining
- **Position data**: Calibrates difficulty assessment against the site's real ranking outcomes
- **CTR data**: Validates intent classification (high CTR vs expected = strong intent match)

See `keyword-researcher/SKILL.md` for how GSC data integrates into each analysis phase.

**Expected Output:**
- Volume, difficulty, intent classification (GSC-calibrated when available)
- Long-tail keyword expansion (10-15, supplemented by GSC-discovered queries)
- Semantic keyword clusters (3-5)
- `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/keyword-research.md`

**Time:** 6-10 minutes

---

### Step 2C: Research Synthesis

**After parallel research completes:**

1. Merge `research-primary.md` + `research-landscape.md`
2. Create unified `research-brief.md`
3. Resolve conflicts (use conservative SME requirements)

---

### Step 2D: Quick Fact-Check

**Invoke `fact-checker` agent (quick mode):**

```
Invoke fact-checker agent in quick mode.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Source: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/research-brief.md
```

**Expected Output:**
- Claim verification status
- `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/claim-audit-quick.md`

**Blocking Gate:** If FAIL → address critical claims before proceeding.

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

---

## Phase 3: Writing & Enhancement

### Step 3A: Write Draft

**Invoke `@writer` agent:**

```
Invoke @writer agent.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Research Brief: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/research-brief.md
Keyword Research: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/keyword-research.md
Format: [format from calendar]
Tier: [T1|T2|T3|T4] (from calendar-context.json)
Opportunity Score: [score] (from calendar-context.json)
GSC Data: [Pass gsc-article-data.md path if GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true]
```

**GSC Enhancement for @writer (conditional):**
If `GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true`, the writer receives:
- **Expansion queries**: High-impression queries from the query ecosystem that should become H2/H3 sections
- **Question-form queries**: Real questions users search for -- these become FAQ entries or inline answers
- **Content recommendations**: Specific section suggestions from the GSC article data report
- The writer incorporates these into the article structure without disrupting the natural content flow

**Tier-Adaptive Depth Guidelines (NEW):**

Pass tier classification to writer with specific depth expectations:

- **T1 (Score ≥4.0):** Comprehensive, detailed content
  - Word count: 1,800-2,200 words
  - Depth: Expert-level tutorial or in-depth analysis
  - Examples: Multiple detailed code examples, comprehensive troubleshooting sections
  - Expected sections: 8-10 H2 sections with substantial depth

- **T2 (Score 3.0-3.9):** Standard, well-developed content
  - Word count: 1,400-1,800 words
  - Depth: Intermediate-level analysis or standard guide
  - Examples: 2-3 practical examples with explanations
  - Expected sections: 6-8 H2 sections

- **T3 (Score 2.0-2.9):** Focused, concise content
  - Word count: 1,000-1,400 words
  - Depth: Targeted guide or focused analysis
  - Examples: 1-2 key examples
  - Expected sections: 4-6 H2 sections

- **T4 (Score <2.0):** Quick overview or introduction
  - Word count: 800-1,200 words
  - Depth: Overview or basic introduction
  - Examples: Single illustrative example
  - Expected sections: 4-5 H2 sections

**@writer responsibilities:**
- Match voice & reading level from config
- Use plain language; include disclaimers where required
- Add alt text for images; ensure table headers
- **Apply tier-specific word count targets** (see above)
- Document tier classification in draft metadata

**Output:** `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/draft.md`

**Time:** 15-25 minutes

---

### Step 3B: Media Discovery

**Invoke `media-discoverer` agent:**

```
Invoke media-discoverer agent.
Topic: "[article topic/keyword]"
Content Type: [format from calendar]
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
```

**Expected Output:**
- Ranked embed candidates (0-3)
- Placement recommendations
- `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/media-discovery.md`

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

---

### Step 3B.5: Media Embed Pre-Validation (NEW)

**Objective:** Validate embeddability BEFORE Phase 4 to prevent late-stage rework

**For articles with media recommendations only.** Skip if media-discovery.md shows 0 candidates.

**Process:**

1. **Read discovered media candidates:**
   ```bash
   # Extract candidate URLs from media-discovery.md
   CANDIDATES=$(grep "url:" project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/media-discovery.md)
   ```

2. **Quick embeddability check for each candidate:**
   ```markdown
   For each media URL:
   - ✅ URL accessible (not 404, not private)
   - ✅ Platform supports embedding (YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram)
   - ✅ Content is public (not requires login)
   - ✅ Not geo-blocked (accessible from target regions)
   - ⚠️ Flag if any validation fails
   ```

3. **Validation methods:**
   - **YouTube:** Check video is public, not deleted
   - **Twitter/X:** Check tweet is public, account not private
   - **LinkedIn:** Check post is public, not requires login
   - **Instagram:** Check post is public, account not private

4. **Update media-discovery.md with validation status:**
   ```markdown
   ## Media Embed Pre-Validation Results

   **Candidates (3):**

   1. ✅ YouTube: https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123
      - Status: VALIDATED
      - Embeddable: Yes
      - Public: Yes
      - Notes: Active, official WooCommerce channel

   2. ❌ Twitter: https://twitter.com/user/status/xyz789
      - Status: FAILED
      - Embeddable: No
      - Issue: Account is private
      - Action: Request alternative from writer

   3. ⚠️ LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/posts/...
      - Status: WARNING
      - Embeddable: Yes (with caveats)
      - Issue: Requires LinkedIn login to view full content
      - Action: Consider alternative or use with disclaimer

   **Summary:**
   - Validated: 1/3
   - Failed: 1/3
   - Warnings: 1/3
   - Recommendation: Replace private Twitter embed before Phase 4
   ```

5. **If validation failures exist:**
   - Request writer to find alternative embeds (brief note in draft)
   - Update media-discovery.md with replacement candidates
   - Mark failed embeds for removal

**Benefits:**
- Prevents editor discovering broken embeds 10+ minutes later
- Writer can find replacements while context is fresh
- Reduces rework in Phase 4
- Ensures all embeds work before editorial review

**Decision Tree:**
- **All candidates validated:** Proceed to Step 3C
- **1-2 failures:** Note in draft, proceed (editor will verify)
- **All candidates failed:** Skip media embeds, proceed

**Time:** 2-3 minutes (saves 5-10 minutes in Phase 4 if issues found)

---

### Step 3C: SEO Optimization

**Invoke `seo-optimizer` agent:**

```
Invoke seo-optimizer agent.
Article: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/draft.md
Primary Keyword: "[primary keyword]"
Tier: [T1|T2|T3|T4] (from calendar-context.json)
GSC Data: [Pass gsc-article-data.md path if GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true]
```

**GSC Enhancement for seo-optimizer (conditional):**
If `GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true`, the SEO optimizer receives:
- **Authority-ranked internal link targets**: Pages with high authority scores (position <5, high clicks) become preferred internal link sources. Replaces generic internal linking with data-driven link targets.
- **Site-specific CTR benchmarks**: The site's own CTR curve by position calibrates meta title/description optimization targets instead of using industry averages.

See `seo-optimization/SKILL.md` for how GSC data integrates into Checklist #3 (Meta Elements) and Checklist #4 (Internal Linking).

**Tier-Adaptive SEO Targets (NEW):**

Pass tier classification to SEO optimizer for appropriate expectations:

- **T1 (Score ≥4.0):** Comprehensive SEO optimization
  - Target word count: 2,000+ words
  - Expected H2 sections: 8-10
  - Internal links: 5-7
  - Keyword density: 1.5-2%
  - Long-tail variations: 5+

- **T2 (Score 3.0-3.9):** Standard SEO optimization
  - Target word count: 1,600+ words
  - Expected H2 sections: 6-8
  - Internal links: 4-6
  - Keyword density: 1.2-1.8%
  - Long-tail variations: 3-5

- **T3 (Score 2.0-2.9):** Focused SEO optimization
  - Target word count: 1,200+ words
  - Expected H2 sections: 4-6
  - Internal links: 3-5
  - Keyword density: 1-1.5%
  - Long-tail variations: 2-3

- **T4 (Score <2.0):** Basic SEO optimization
  - Target word count: 1,000+ words
  - Expected H2 sections: 4-5
  - Internal links: 2-4
  - Keyword density: 1-1.2%
  - Long-tail variations: 1-2

**Expected Output:**
- Meta title (≤60 chars), meta description (150-160 chars)
- Keyword placement audit (tier-adjusted targets)
- Internal linking recommendations (tier-adjusted count)
- E-E-A-T cues
- `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/seo-audit.md`

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

---

## Phase 4: Review & Export

### Step 4A: Editorial Review

**Invoke `@editor` agent:**

```
Invoke @editor agent.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Draft: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/draft.md
SEO Audit: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/seo-audit.md
Media Discovery: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/media-discovery.md
Tier: [T1|T2|T3|T4] (from calendar-context.json)
Opportunity Score: [score]
GSC Data: [Pass gsc-article-data.md path if GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true]
```

**GSC Enhancement for @editor (conditional):**
If `GSC_DATA_AVAILABLE=true`, the editor performs an additional validation:
- **Query coverage check**: Verify that high-impression queries from the GSC query ecosystem are addressed in the article content. Flag any primary or secondary queries (impressions > configured threshold) that are not covered.
- This ensures the article captures the real search demand identified by GSC data.

**Tier-Adaptive Review Stringency (NEW):**

Editor applies review rigor based on tier:

- **T1 (Score ≥4.0):** Comprehensive review
  - Full fact-check with comprehensive mode (15+ min)
  - Thorough claim verification across all sources
  - Detailed compliance review
  - Complete media embed validation
  - Full gap analysis mandate checklist validation

- **T2 (Score 3.0-3.9):** Standard review
  - Standard fact-check with comprehensive mode (10-12 min)
  - Verify key claims and statistics
  - Standard compliance checks
  - Media embed validation
  - Spot-check gap analysis tactics

- **T3 (Score 2.0-2.9):** Focused review
  - Targeted fact-check (8-10 min)
  - Verify statistics and legal/compliance claims only
  - Basic compliance checks
  - Quick media validation
  - Review only P1 gap tactics

- **T4 (Score <2.0):** Basic review
  - Light fact-check (5-8 min)
  - Verify only legal/compliance claims
  - Basic brand voice check
  - Skip media validation (low visual need)
  - Minimal gap validation

**@editor responsibilities:**
- Source verification, date-check facts (tier-adjusted depth)
- Compliance: claims policy, privacy, accessibility
- Brand voice consistency
- Media embed validation (if present, tier-adjusted)
- Add YAML frontmatter
- **Validate gap analysis mandate checklist** (tier-adjusted)

**Output:** `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/article.md`

**Time:** 10-15 minutes (T1-T2), 8-12 minutes (T3), 5-10 minutes (T4)

---

### Step 4B: Comprehensive Fact-Check

**Invoke `fact-checker` agent (comprehensive mode):**

```
Invoke fact-checker agent in comprehensive mode.
Article ID: [ARTICLE-ID]
Source: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/article.md
```

**Expected Output:**
- Full claim verification with web search
- `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/claim-audit-full.md`

**Blocking Gate:** If FAIL → revisions required before export.

**Time:** 5-10 minutes

---

### Step 4C: CMS Export

**Invoke `cms-exporter` agent:**

```
Invoke cms-exporter agent.
Article: project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/article.md
Format: [from config - gutenberg | ghost | medium | html]
```

**Expected Output:**
- CMS-ready export file
- `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/article.html` (or format-specific)

**Time:** 30-60 seconds

---

## Phase 5: Finalization

### Step 5A: Generate Metadata

Create `project/Articles/[ARTICLE-ID]/meta.yml` with 20 sections:

1. Article Identification (ID, format, funnel stage)
2. Publication Details (title, slug, date, author)
3. Content Summary (excerpt, word count, personas)
4. SEO Metadata (meta title, description, keywords)
5. Links & Citations (internal, external)
6. Compliance & Legal (disclaimers, flags)
7. Accessibility (checklist, notes)
8. Visual Assets (featured image, diagrams)
9. Code Examples (language, status)
10. Embeds & Media (count, metadata)

12. Competitive Analysis (scores, differentiation) **[ENHANCED - see below]**
13. SEO Performance Expectations (SERP, traffic)
14. Fact-Checking Status (quick, comprehensive)
15. Editorial Review (status, blockers)
16. Publication Readiness (recommendation)
17. Performance Tracking (KPIs)
18. File Inventory (all generated files)
19. Workflow Metadata (agents, timing)
20. Production Notes
